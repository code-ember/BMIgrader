# BMI Calculator
Object challenge with Java

In this lab, you will enhance the Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator you created in a previous video that demonstrated utility classes. You will gain practical experience by creating and using multiple classes with different methods and invoking them in various contexts. Building on the fundamental features of the original BMI calculator, which included the ability to calculate BMI in both the imperial and metric systems, you will continue to focus on these core capabilities.

First, you'll obtain user input for their preferred BMI system, either imperial or metric. Next, you'll gather the user's weight and height. Using the chosen system, you will then calculate the BMI value accordingly. Following this, you will determine the BMI category based on the calculated value. Finally, you will display both the calculated BMI value and the corresponding category to the user. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of class interaction and method invocation while maintaining the essential functionality of the BMI calculator.

## Goal
Develop a user-friendly application that calculates and categorizes BMI based on user input for weight, height, and preferred measurement system.

## Before Begining
You have received partial source code in BMICalculator.java, UserInput.java, and Main.java.

The *UserInput.java* class has the following methods already implemented for you: 

## obtainBMISystem:
Contains a *Scanner* that captures user input for the preferred BMI system, validates the user input, and returns it.

## obtainWeight:
Uses a *Scanner* to capture user input for weight in pounds or kilograms based on the entered BMI system. It also features a *switch* statement that determines whether the weight should be obtained in pounds or kilograms based on the BMI system. Additionally, it includes a while loop that controls obtaining user input for weight until a valid value is entered.

The *Main.java* class has the following already implemented for you: 

- Code that declares and initializes some required variables (primitive and reference).

- A partially written *switch* statement that obtains user input.

- Code to display outputs to the user.

Complete the following tasks to implement each method and attain your objectives. Good luck!
